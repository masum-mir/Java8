Java socket programming is used for communication between the applications running on different JRE.
    Java socket programming can be connection-oriented or connection-less.
Socket and Serverscoket classes are used for connection-oriented socket programming and Datagramsocket, and
    Datagramsocket classes are used for connection-less socket programming.


The client is socket programming must know two information:
    1. Ip address of server, and
    2. port number


                                                     . . . . .
                [        open client           ]     >       .
                Client ----------------> connect-->write-->read-->close
                                            .         .     <       .
                                connection  .         .     .       . end of file
                                   request  >         >     .       >
                server -->bind-->listen--> accept-->read-->write-->read-->close
                [        open listen   ]     <                              .
                                             .  .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

                                        Socket API

    Creating server:

        ServerSocket s = new ServerSocket(4040);
        Socket so = s.accept();     // establishes connection and waits for the client

    Creating client:
        Socket s = new Socket("localhost", 4040);
